Okay, here's how you actually run the code(if you haven't use git/python before):

1. You should see a green button near the top of this repository that says code. Click on it, and click download zip. Extract the zip to get a folder.

2. If you don't have python already installed, install it at https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. right click the folder you extracted, and click "open in terminal"

4. run the command
>python main.py

in the terminal, and press enter.

You can zoom with scroll wheel. If something doesn't work you should let me know.
