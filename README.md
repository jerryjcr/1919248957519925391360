Hi Alena! Happy(belated) birthday again. I hope your Gregory House body pillow keeps you good company !!
Anyways, this repository contains a master work viewer that I made. I remember us saying we wanted to go through and explain the inside jokes on it the next time we saw each other, but since it seems that might not happen for a while, I made this instead.

I know I don't express it as much as you and Kayley, but I miss and love you as much as you miss and love us. Remember that I will always be your friend, even if we don't see each other for long periods of time. I hope that when me and Kayley feel far away, you'll come back to this, to remember that even though our bodies are distant, our memories are always together: a single sheet of gold, to airy thinness beat. I hope you have a good year Alena, you really deserve it.

Love,
Jerry

Okay, here's how you actually run the code(if you haven't use git/python before):

1. You should see a green button near the top of this repository that says code. Click on it, and click download zip. Extract the zip to get a folder.

2. If you don't have python already installed, install it at https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. right click the folder you extracted, and click "open in terminal"

4. run the commands:
>pip install Pillow

>python main.py

in the terminal, and press enter.

You can zoom with scroll wheel. If something doesn't work you should let me know.
